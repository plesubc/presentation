# WE ARE DATA

You are not data<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:


While it's tempting to comment on the transition from human to commodity, this is not what this is about.

"I am not a number, I am a free man!"

# INTRODUCTION

Note:

This is an introduction to data services and the data team. Hopefully you will leave with a better idea of what we do.

It likely won't cover everything, not least because we have probably forgotten something

The history of data services at UBC is long and has largely defined why we have what we have today, so we will need an overview

---

## Data is older than you think

![1970s](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/flowers.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400" -->


Note:

The first data services at UBC started in the 1970s

Part of Computer Science, in the Klinck building

Data came on punchcards, all documentation was printed, and sometimes even the data

The vast majority of the data was social science data, because they were the early adopters

---

## Advancing towards the milllennium 

![1990s](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/computer_90s.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

By the 1990s, things came on tape and campus networking was available. There was a central UNIX server and data was "accessible" to people who knew these things

Things were on tape and uploaded painfully to servers with printed documentation

---

## The dawn of a beautiful new era

![Mission Accomplished](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/bush.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

By the turn of the century, Data Services left Computer Science had been absorbed in to the library as its own division ("Data Services")

Where the RDC is now

Presumably because it was mostly social sciences data?

From the late 1990s to about 2000 data was migrated on to the "world-wide-web". Well, sort of. Metadata was, but data was restricted to unixg and documentation was in print. But there was a web page!

---

## Integration
![Borg Cube](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/borg.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

Then came the itegration with  HSS

As is tradition with geeky people, servers had Star Trek names: spock, mccoy

Those who are in the know will realize that borg cube is not from TOS, but TNG

You will be assimilated: By the Library

This is when Paul starts working here. I am old.

The digital revolution on the information superhighway v2.0

---

## Evolution
![Skeletons](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/skeletons.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->


Note:

Printed documentation and metadata was eventually added, painfully, by hand-crafted HTML pages
    This was not a viable way forward

A marginally better system arose where metadata was added to the LAMP stack
    This still sucked

We still have a backup of this website
    And it's still sometimes useful

---

## Transformation
![Pokemon](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/pokemon.png)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

Actual data moved to DSpace!
    "Integration" with SFU, UVic, UNBC

CWL logins for actual data!

Then we moved to Dataverse (3)

Then 4

Then 5

Hopefully soon 6

GIS integration!

And moved to the RC!

---

# PEOPLE

If I could make a comprehensible Venn diagram it might go here.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


Note:
This doesn't answer the questions about what we actually do, but it may start to give you an idea

But all of this was accomplished because of the people involved so now we will start talking about them, and what they actually do. And it's very messy and it likely won't cover everything

Obviously, this is not constant, because Jeremy is on leave, so Maggie is temporary, etc.



---

## Milan

Note:

This one is a bit tricky because we haven't had time to do any training with Milan, so this may come as a surprise to him

30% data librarian?

I hope that he will cover data reference questions, how to use Abacus, basic trouble shooting etc.

He will very likely be better suited for linguistics data (mention LDC collection)

Right now we are still figuring things out

---

## Sarah Parker

And also a student whose name I can't remember<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

In Jeremy's absence, Sarah is taking over his instructional duties

GAA will work on data-related RC courses

Maggie will likely also assist, but the GAA is primarily Sarah's responsiblity at this time

Will probably change back to Jeremy in January

---

## Maggie Kikkert

Also Jeremy<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

There is a great deal of overlap between Paul and Maggie, the notable lack of which is the instructional portion, so you can assume that everything here also applies to Paul

---

## Helping people find and use data

This includes everyone, maybe even you<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

"I need help with [data]!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->


Note: 

Reference can take up a sizeable chunk of time, and it can be completely irregular

---

## Sidebar(s)

What is "data"?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

"I know it when I see it"

But do you, really?

---

## Data and Statistics

You say you want data. . .<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

There is a difference between data and statistics, and semantic hairsplitting aside, demand for 'data' is often demand for statistics.

Statistics are the result of data analysis: thing pre-made tables etc.

Data are (is!) the building block of statistics.

Insert some sort of data/statistics anecdote

Where these things exist depends on whether they are stats or data

---

## What kind of things

![All the things](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/things.gif)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->


Note: 

So what types of things do we help with?

---
## A non-exhaustive list
Census data<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" style="font-size:0.5em; text-align:left; line-height:0.1em"-->

Restricted data<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" style="font-size:0.5em; text-align:left; line-height:0.1em; font-weight:bold" -->


Note:
Expound in depth: Alternate so that one person doesn't die of exhaustion?

---

## The microdata

Individual data points<!--.element class="fragment" -->

And unless you're a savant, this requires use statistical software<!--.element class="fragment" -->

<span class="fragment">

* R  

* SPSS  

* Stata  

* SAS  

* Other (Python, JASP, whatever)

</span>


Note:

What makes our services special is microdata

Allows users to make custom analyses from "raw" data points

Need statistical software like the list

We (the vendor, hopefully) supply the data and the code to use with the big 3: Stata, SPSS, SAS. 

While we don't offer detailed methodological support for these packages, we do have workshops (R, sometimes SPSS), consultations (student) and reference about these things

---

## Everyone's favourite

<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">

[Subject guides](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/datastatistics)

</span>

Note:

Maggie - show the guide in the browser and talk a bit about the changes (new Stats Canada page, highlight data/statistics sources page)

The data subject guide was recently revamped to be current and actually helpful. A guide to microdata is planned/in progress
 
---
   
## Analog

Printed censuses<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left"-->

Historical data<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left"-->

UN<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

League of Nations<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

Parliamentary data of various kinds<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

US data<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

The great catch all: other<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

Note:

Not everything is in digital form, no matter how often people believe it must be so. We offer support to find older data in print and microform, including, but not limited to the following

This is where a government publication expert also can come in handy

---

## Maggie's duties

Note:

Maggie is responsible for most of the reference and instructional stuff. Jeremy probably normally does a lot more than this. I am only working part-time while he is away and don't have his full responsibilities.

---

## Providing Reference Help

Research consultation<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left"-->

Finding and accessing data<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left"-->

Statistics Canada<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:left; line-height:0.5em; text-indent:3em"-->

BC Assessment<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:left; line-height:0.5em; text-indent:3em"-->

Microdata<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:left; line-height:0.5em; text-indent:3em"-->

International data<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:left; line-height:0.5em; text-indent:3em"-->

Note:

Maggie helps answer reference questions, allegedley

Pointing out where to go to look for data and helping access data. If it is GIS related, then Paul usually does it

Primarily assisting with data available from Statistics Canada, but also includes things like the BC Assessment data (which has pretty strict terms of use so researchers are required to meet with me/Paul before they get access), microdata, US/international data

---

## Instruction

Classroom sessions<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Digital learning resources<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Workshops<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Note:

I am available to do classroom sessions on data literacy and access, the data available at UBC and the resources the research commons and data librarian offers for interacting with data

I am accumulating as many digital learning resources relating to data as I can, both for myself and for anyone I may be helping with a reference question

I can also help with supporting workshops, if that is needed at any point - Sarah Parker is currently leading the Data GAAs and workshops

---

## Miscellany

Updating the LibGuide<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Assisting with the maintenance of Abacus data<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Keeping an eye out for additional data to acquire<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

Note:



---

## Paul Lesack

Note:

As mentioned before, Paul also does many/all of these things, but there's also more

---
### Abacus<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
<https://abacus.library.ubc.ca><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

If you have never heard of Abacus you should bookmark it now

Paul maintains and runs Abacus, which holds more than 2400 data sets

A shared repository for UBC, UNBC, UVic, SFU and because a lot of statcan data is in there, Canada and the world

Fed to FRDR

De facto source for Statistics Canada microdata

This annoys Scholars Portal

---
    
## What about Abacus?

---

## The data and metadata

Note:

Paul adds the overwhelming majority of content 

Create comprehensible metadata from poorly documented data

As a result, probably has the best knowledge of what is *in* abacus

This includes all the other institutions as well

Also structures the data so it's not a godawful mess (looking at you statcan)

---

# The service itself 

<span class="fragment" style="text-align:left">

* User management

* Integration with the catalogue
 
* FRDR/Geodisy integration
 
* Upgrade paths
 
* Repairs/fixes

</span>

Note:

An example: Open Index map viewer in Abacus

Or: Github integration for open index maps

Work-arounds for terrible bugs in Dataverse

**Paul can usually fix the server if the service is down**

---

# Dealing with vendors

Note:

The official representative for Statistics Canada. Note that Jeremy works with ICPSR

Insert story about how the DLI works

* Answers questions for data librarians in Canada

* Gives statcan tips on how to clean their terrible data

* Obtaining data from other vendors (like governments or private corporations)

---

## Specialized data set support

<span class="fragment" style="text-align:left">

* Terrain Resource Information Management data
* BC Assessment Data
* etc

</span>

Note:

Not all data is immediately available for download from Abacus

Some are a mediated service, or are restricted, or have another special needs

---

## Custom product support

<span class="fragment" style="text-align:left">

* Custom tabulations

* Real-time Remote Access (RTRA) Program

</span>

Note: 

Some services require cooperation with vendors (custom tabs), or special acounts technical expertise, like SAS for RTRA. 

Explain these services

---


## Plays with others 

Data tools for librarians, UBC researchers and other libraries

<span class="fragment" style="text-align:left">

* [dataverse_utils](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/dataverse_utils)
* [dryad2dataverse](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/dryad2dataverse)
* [damage](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/fcheck/)
* Geospatial data extraction tools used by U of T/ Scholars Portal

<span>

Note:
There's more, but you get the idea

---

## Print

Note:

In theory, Paul catalogues the Koerner Data Codebooks print collection.

Print materials do not arrive frequently, but if you're looking for something in print you know who to ask


---


## WHEN TO COME TO US

<span class="fragment" style="text-align:left">

* Someone is searching for "data"
* There is a need for a specialized workshop
* ECON 490
* Microdata support
* Historical statistics
* Custom tabulations
* Issues with Abacus
* Statistical software problems
* Data purchases
* Data gifts/donations

</span>

Note:

"Data" in this case is usually governmental or commercial data sets

Econ 490 is a *microdata* course and they almost always need data from Abacus

Statistical software is one of those grey areas. We don't offer methodological support, but we can help with a lot of other issues. If you're note sure, refer to us and we can pass patrons on if required. I am not a statistician.

---

## And you'd think we'd deal with this
#### But we (generally) don't<!--.element class="fragment"--> 

<span class="fragment">
    
* Pure health data (ie, medical research data, genetic data, etc)

* Pure science data (chemistry, biology, astronomy, etc)

* Research Data Management (Eugene will talk about this soon!)


</span>
---

## Sample questions

* I need to figure out how to extract something from 600 files
* "In this file, there are four factors considered for Material deprivation, but I see that the research papers only show one score for Material deprivation. I would like to learn how I should use the Stat Can table. Should I just average out the scores for all four factors and report the average score as Material Deprivation?"
* Historical population changes in Spences Bridge BC from the 19th century onwards
* Interpreting the structure of multiple years of the Canadian Community Health Survey
* The Statistics Canada Index of Remoteness and how to apply to differing census areas
* Abacus is down
---

## The massive overlap component

Government Publications (Susan Paterson)  
GIS (Alex/Paul)  
RDM (Eugene/Paul)  
Digital Scholarship (Eka)  
Economics and Finance (David Lam)  
Internal data (Jeremy/Meghan)  

Note:

As everyone knows, data isn't a neatly categorized thing. The data group also works with these other groups as applicable, some more than others.

---

# IN CONCLUSION

We are all doomed<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

We are probably not doomed. It's hard to say.
