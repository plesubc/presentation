# WE ARE DATA

You are not data<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:


While it's tempting to comment on the transition from human to commodity, this is not what this is about.

"I am not a number, I am a free man!"

# INTRODUCTION

Note:

This is an introduction to data services and the data team. Hopefully you will leave with a better idea of what we do.

It likely won't cover everything, not least because we have probably forgotten something

The history of data services at UBC is long and has largely defined why we have what we have today, so we will need an overview

---

## Data is older than you think

![1970s](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/flowers.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400" -->


Note:

The first data services at UBC started in the 1970s

Part of Computer Science, in the Klinck building

Data came on punchcards, all documentation was printed, and sometimes even the data

The vast majority of the data was social science data, because they were the early adopters

---

## Advancing towards the milllennium 

![1990s](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/computer_90s.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

By the 1990s, things came on tape and campus networking was available. There was a central UNIX server and data was "accessible" to people who knew these things

Things were on tape and uploaded painfully to servers with printed documentation

---

## The dawn of a beautiful new era

![Mission Accomplished](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/bush.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

By the turn of the century, Data Services left Computer Science had been absorbed in to the library as its own division ("Data Services")

Where the RDC is now

Presumably because it was mostly social sciences data?

From the late 1990s to about 2000 data was migrated on to the "world-wide-web". Well, sort of. Metadata was, but data was restricted to unixg and documentation was in print. But there was a web page!

---

## Integration
![Borg Cube](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/borg.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

Then came the itegration with  HSS

As is tradition with geeky people, servers had Star Trek names: spock, mccoy

Those who are in the know will realize that borg cube is not from TOS, but TNG

You will be assimilated: By the Library

This is when Paul starts working here. I am old.

The digital revolution on the information superhighway v2.0

---

## Evolution
![Skeletons](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/skeletons.jpg)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->


Note:

Printed documentation and metadata was eventually added, painfully, by hand-crafted HTML pages
    This was not a viable way forward

A marginally better system arose where metadata was added to the LAMP stack
    This still sucked

We still have a backup of this website
    And it's still sometimes useful

---

## Transformation
![Pokemon](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/pokemon.png)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->

Note:

Actual data moved to DSpace!
    "Integration" with SFU, UVic, UNBC

CWL logins for actual data!

Then we moved to Dataverse (3)

Then 4

Then 5

Hopefully soon 6

GIS integration!

And moved to the RC!

---

# PEOPLE

If I could make a comprehensible Venn diagram it might go here.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


Note:
This doesn't answer the questions about what we actually do, but it may start to give you an idea

But all of this was accomplished because of the people involved so now we will start talking about them, and what they actually do. And it's very messy and it likely won't cover everything

Obviously, this is not constant, because Jeremy is on leave, so Maggie is temporary, etc.



---

## Milan

Note:

This one is a bit tricky because we haven't had time to do any training with Milan, so this may come as a surprise to him

30% data librarian?

I hope that he will cover data reference questions, how to use Abacus, basic trouble shooting etc.

He will very likely be better suited for linguistics data (mention LDC collection)

Right now we are still figuring things out

---

## Sarah Parker

And also a student whose name I can't remember<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

In Jeremy's absence, Sarah is taking over his instructional duties

GAA will work on data-related RC courses

Maggie will likely also assist, but the GAA is primarily Sarah's responsiblity at this time

Will probably change back to Jeremy in January

---

## Maggie Kikkert

Also Jeremy<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

There is a great deal of overlap between Paul and Maggie, the notable lack of which is the instructional portion, so you can assume that everything here also applies to Paul

---

## Helping people find and use data

This includes everyone, maybe even you<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

"I need help with [data]!"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->


Note: 

Reference can take up a sizeable chunk of time, and it can be completely irregular

---

## Sidebar(s)

What is "data"?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

"I know it when I see it"

But do you, really?

---

## Data and Statistics

You say you want data. . .<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

There is a difference between data and statistics, and semantic hairsplitting aside, demand for 'data' is often demand for statistics.

Statistics are the result of data analysis: thing pre-made tables etc.

Data are (is!) the building block of statistics.

Insert some sort of data/statistics anecdote

Where these things exist depends on whether they are stats or data

---

## What kind of things

![All the things](Images/2023-10-25_Intro_Data/things.gif)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" height="400"-->


Note: 

So what types of things do we help with?

## The microdata

Individual data points<!--.element class="fragment" -->

And unless you're a savant, this requires use statistical software<!--.element class="fragment" -->

<span class="fragment">

* R  

* SPSS  

* Stata  

* SAS  

* Other (Python, JASP, whatever)

</span>


Note:

What makes our services special is microdata

Allows users to make custom analyses from "raw" data points

Need statistical software like the list

We (the vendor, hopefully) supply the data and the code to use with the big 3: Stata, SPSS, SAS. 

While we don't offer detailed methodological support for these packages, we do have workshops (R, sometimes SPSS), consultations (student) and reference about these things

## Everyone's favourite 

<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">

[Subject guides](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/datastatistics)

Note:

The data subject guide was recently revamped to be current and actually helpful. A guide to microdata is planned/in progress

## Analog

Printed Censuses<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left"-->

Historical data<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left"-->

UN<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

League of Nations<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

Parliamentary data of various kinds<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

US data<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

The great catch all: other<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="text-align:left; text-indent:3em"-->

Note:

Not everything is in digital form, no matter how often people believe it must be so. We offer support to find older data in print and microform, including, but not limited to the following

This is where a government publication expert also can come in handy

## Other Maggie data things that I missed, like the instructional component

## Paul Lesack


    Data cleaning
    offer some guidelines but we do not clean data as a general rule
        Unless it's our vendors' data. 
            This happens more than you might think
                That's why they hate us
    
Plus we make sure that Abacus is functioning
        Upgrade paths
        Repairs/fixes
        User management
        Integration with the catalogue
        FRDR/Geodisy
        De facto source for Statistics Canada microdata
            This annoys Scholars Portal

    Maintain necessary data related software: R (Studio), Stata, etc
    Maintain and build additions to Abacus and Dataverse
        Open Index map viewer in Abacus
        Geodisy FRDR integration standards
        Create comprehensible metadata from poorly documented data
        Work-arounds for terrible bugs in Dataverse
        
    Manage print codebook collection
    Test server too

    Data tools for librarians, UBC researchers and other libraries
        dataverse_utils
        dryad2dataverse
        damage
        Data extraction tools for DMTI for U of T

    Paul provides Abacus support for SFU, UVic and UNBC.

    UBC's representative to Statistics Canada
    Real time remote access program
    Sends angry emails

## And you'd think we'd deal with this
#### But we don't<!--.element class="fragment"--> 

<span class="fragment">
    
* Health data (ie, medical research data, genetic data, etc)

* Pure science (chemistry, biology, astronomy, etc)

## The massive overlap component

Government Publications (Susan Paterson)  
GIS (Alex/Paul)  
RDM (Eugene/Paul)  
Digital Scholarship (Eka)  
Economics and Finance (David Lam)  
Internal data (Jeremy/Meghan)  

Note:

As everyone knows, data isn't a neatly categorized thing. The data group also works with these other groups as applicable, some more than others.
